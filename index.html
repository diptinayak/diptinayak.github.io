          <h2> Biographical Sketch </h2>
          Dipti is a Life Science Research Foundation Fellow courtesy of the <a href="https://www.simonsfoundation.org/life-sciences/simons-postdoctoral-fellowships-in-life-sciences/">Simon's Foundation</a> (awarded nationally to ~30 from over 1000 candidates in all
          fields of life sciences), and a <a href="http://www.igb.illinois.edu/involve/become-a-fellow">Carl Woese Institute for Genomic Biology Fellow</a> at the University of Illinois, working with Prof. <a href="https://mcb.illinois.edu/faculty/profile/metcalf/">William Metcalf</a>. Dipti received her PhD 
          from the <a href="https://oeb.harvard.edu/">Organismic and Evolutionary Biology Department</a> 
          at Harvard University, under the direction of Prof. <a href="https://marxlab.org/">Chris Marx</a> in 2014, and a Masters degree from 
                the <a href="https://cee.stanford.edu/people/">Civil and Environmental Engineering Department</a> at Stanford University in 2009. 
          Her dissertation focused on using experimental evolution to study metabolism and stress response in microorganisms that grow on reduced single-carbon compounds (methylotrophs). Her postdoctoral research has focused on the physiology and evolution of methanogenic archaea, employing CRISPR-Cas9-based genome-editing tools &mdash; <a href="http://www.cell.com/trends/microbiology/fulltext/S0966-842X(17)30072-0">the first successful application of CRISPR-Cas on a member of the archeal domain</a>. 
          <br/> <br/>

          Dipti received the Best Poster Award (1 out of ~100 posters) at the <a href="https://www.grc.org/programs.aspx?id=10900">Gordon Research Conference on Applied and Environmental Microbiology</a> (2017) and 
          the Best Poster Award (3 out of ~100 posters) at the <a href="https://www.grc.org/programs.aspx?id=12764">Gordon Research Conference on the Molecular Basis of Microbial One-Carbon Metabolism</a> (2016). She received a <a href="https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/certificates-excellence-and-distinction-teaching-recipients-fall-2013">Distinction in Teaching from Harvard University</a> (2013), a Young Investigator Oral Abstract Presentation from the American Society of Microbiology (2013), the Sigma Xi Grants in Aid-of-Research (2012), as well as
          multiple graduate fellowships from Harvard University (2009) and Stanford University (2007). Dipti served as the <a href="https://www.grc.org/programs.aspx?id=15360">Chair</a> (2016) and the <a href="https://www.grc.org/programs.aspx?id=1535">Vice-Chair</a> (2014) of the Gordon Research Seminar on the Microbial Basis of One-Carbon Metabolism.

          <h2> Motivation and Research Interests </h2>
          <p>
           Methane is a tremendous societal burden and a resource: on the one hand, it is a potent greenhouse gas, and on the other, it is a cheap, renewable fuel. Technological advances are needed at both ends: for mitigating atmospheric emissions, as well as converting organic-rich effluents to methane. 
           At the heart of these problems, and their solutions, lie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methanogen">methanogenic</a> and <a>methanotrophic</a> archaea: the primary producers and consumers of methane respectively. 
           </p><p>
          Despite being ubiquitous, and encompassing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-domain_system">domain of Life distinct from eukaryotes and bacteria</a>, archaea are among the least-characterized life forms on Earth. A strictly anaerobic lifestyle and slow growth have particularly impeded comprehensive studies of methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea; therefore our understanding of these pivotal microorganisms is severely deficient. By integrating an evolutionary framework (from my graduate research) with a rapid, multiplexed genome editing toolkit (developed during my <a href="http://igb.illinois.edu/news/new-tool-genetically-engineering-oldest-branch-life">postdoctoral research</a>), I overcome these roadblocks to design a wide-range of experimental platforms to test prevailing hypotheses, as well as discover novel and unique features of methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea. 
          </p><p>
          Broadly, my research is at <b><i>the intersection of physiology and evolution, with a goal to understand the fundamental and distinctive biology of methanogenic and methanotrophic archaea from an organismal and community perspective</i></b>. This knowlege is key to designing optimized solutions for aforementioned environmental and biotechnological problems.

This seminar is held for two days prior to the corresponding Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and is organized by and for early-career scientists. As the Chair, my duties involved screening and selecting ~50 participants from all over the globe, inviting prominent scientists as keynote speakers and discussion leaders, and also acquiring external funding for the meeting. In addition, I developed a mentorship component for the 2016 meeting titled ‘Scientific careers beyond the PhD and postdoc’, which included scientists from industry and academia as well as a senior editor for Science. The 2016 meeting
          spanned twelve talks over two days, along with a keynote.
